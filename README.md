# Ironside
A game project developed with the Unreal Engine.
This is a work in progress, a way to familiarize ourselves with game development in Unreal.

## What is it?
Ironside is a top down competitive multiplayer game which pits two wizards against each other.
The effects and effectiveness of your spells can be undermined or empowered by other abilities, the environment and
the current weather. You must establish how, where and **when** to attack your enemy to maximize your chances of success.

## How to run 
- Download the Unreal Engine version version 4.22.3.
- Launch the project.
- NOTE: The online multiplayer component of this game requires steam to be running on your system. 
The current master branch of this project runs locally.
